# Claude Code Project Rules

## Architecture
- Use **Clean Architecture** with clear layer separation (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation)
- Dependencies point inward only; inner layers never depend on outer layers

## Development Methodology
- Apply **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Red → Green → Refactor
- Write tests before implementation
- Maintain high test coverage

## Problem Solving
- Always find and fix the **root cause**, not symptoms
- Avoid quick fixes and band-aid solutions
- Design solutions that prevent recurrence

## AI Assistance
- Utilize **skills** and **agents** proactively
- Use specialized agents for complex tasks (Explore, Plan, feature-dev, code-review)

## Communication
- **Respond in Korean (한국어)**
